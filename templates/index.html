                    <b>What is Duino-Coin?</b>
                </h3>
                Duino-Coin is a coin that can be mined with any low powered devices such as Arduinos! Duino-Coin is striving to be a low powered coin. Coins such as Bitcoin or Ethereum use SO much energy while mining. But with around 7000 connections to the server and around 1000 people mining, we have a low 2 GH/S and 28 KW/H of energy (as of writing - source: https://explorer.duinocoin.com/). Duino-Coin uses a custom algorithm called DUCO-S1 (+DUCO-S1A) which is a implementation from the SHA1 algorithm. Duino-coin also uses XXHASH which relies on the speed of RAM and not on the size, this makes mining on low powered devices possible. In summery DUCO-S1 = CPU mining, and XXHASH =  CPU + RAM mining. Duino-Coin is a project not for earning a lot of money, but for people to learn about crypto-currency. As I mentioned earlier, Duino-Coin is not like Bitcoin, and it striving not to be.
